# Word Hash #

## Introduction ##
This project serves as a repository for implementing and testing various hash functions. Currently, the file hasher.py is intended to serve as a library of various hashing function implementations. The hasher_test.py file is meant to run a program for actually testing these hashing functions.

## Overview of Directory Contents ##
Within this repository there are the following directories:

* frequencies - meant to hold output data of hash functions (currently formatted by separating integer keys on new lines). For example, the frequency of integer output 0 is on the first line. The frequency of 1 is on the second line, and so on.

* datasets - meant to hold onto datasets used for hashing. Currently there is only one data file (a file called word-list.txt that contains about 114,000 words). More files may be added as necessary or for testing different applications.
